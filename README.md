Objective:
Build a simple web-based application that simulates basic computer operations like calculation, text editing, and file organization.

Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend (optional): Node.js or any backend server (for file handling if needed)
Libraries: Bootstrap for styling (optional)

Step-by-Step Implementation:
1. Basic Setup
Create a new folder for the project.
Inside the folder, create the following files:
index.html (for the main webpage)
styles.css (for styling)
script.js (for interactivity)
2. Designing the Layout
Use HTML to structure the layout of the "computer" interface.

Features to Add:
File System Simulation: Add a file system that allows users to create, delete, and view files.
Calculator Enhancements: Improve the calculator with more complex operations.
Saving Files: Implement a backend to save text editor files to a server (Node.js or PHP can handle this).
Customizable Taskbar: Allow users to customize the taskbar and add more “apps” like a clock, weather, or notes app.
